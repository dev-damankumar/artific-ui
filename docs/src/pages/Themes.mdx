<h2>Theme</h2>

Theme defines which colors to apply on your component by default its primary. but it can be one of the four values.

`theme` props has basic four values (`primary`|`secondary`|`dark`|`light`).

`NOTE:` If you want to use a different color scheme for component instead of the provided themes then  you can use
`colorScheme` props to define your color scheme.

colorScheme is an object containing three properties: `background`, `backgroundColor`, `color`.

`background:` is used primarly for backgrond only and its value can be `color` | `gredient` | `url`. its same as the css property `background`

`backgroundColor:` is used primarily for additional properties like outline or border color and it can only have `color` as value its same as the css property `backgroundColor`

`color:` is used to define your text color.

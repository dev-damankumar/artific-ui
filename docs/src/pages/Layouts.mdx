Layout defines how your component's structure is going to look like for example, should it be has rounded corners or should it be circular and so on.

`layout` props has basic four values (`default`|`rounded`|`no-radius`|`pill`).

If you don't understand what this means then explore the components to know more.

`NOTE:` most of the components shares the same values for layout, but it can have some additional or different values based on component's flexibility and design

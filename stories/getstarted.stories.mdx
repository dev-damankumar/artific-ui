<h1>Overview</h1>

Artific UI uses design rules to make components flexible and attractive

Mostly all components shares some common props to make a design flexible. These props define how your component should looks like in terms of <b>ui</b>,  <b>structure</b>,  <b>positioning</b> and  <b>sizing</b>

Here are the main props that are used by almost every component: (`layout`, `theme`, `variant`, `size`)

<h2>Layout</h2>

Layout defines how your component's structure is going to look like for example, should it be has rounded corners or should it be circular and so on.

`layout` props has basic four values (`default`|`rounded`|`no-radius`|`pill`).

If you don't understand what this means then explore the components to know more.

`NOTE:` most of the components shares the same values for layout, but it can have some additional or different values based on component's flexibility and design


<h2>Theme</h2>

Theme defines which colors to apply on your component by default its primary. but it can be one of the four values.

`theme` props has basic four values (`primary`|`secondary`|`dark`|`light`).

`NOTE:` If you want to use a different color scheme for component instead of the provided themes then  you can use
`colorScheme` props to define your color scheme.

colorScheme is an object containing three properties: `background`, `backgroundColor`, `color`.

`background:` is used primarly for backgrond only and its value can be `color` | `gredient` | `url`. its same as the css property `background`

`backgroundColor:` is used primarily for additional properties like outline or border color and it can only have `color` as value its same as the css property `backgroundColor`

`color:` is used to define your text color.

<h2>Variant</h2>

Variant defines how you components ui should look like

`variant` prop has different the values based on which component you are using
but most common are (`default`|`outline`|`separate`|`text`). you can mix them with diffrent supported `theme` or `layout` to make component more customizabe


<h2>Size</h2>

Size prop defines the size of your component that how big or small it should be on screen.

`size` prop has common five values (`xs`|`sm`|`md`|`lg`|`xl`).

values for `size` props can differ for some exceptional components
